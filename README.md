Download Instructions:
You must have Rhino and Grasshopper installed on your computer
Also install the plugin Elefront from Food4Rhino
Note: there needs to be a layer in Rhino called "INPUT CURVES" in order for this tool to detect the lines and update them.
The file here is a Grasshopper script for 'Digital Harvest' created by Frank Hinoporos at CSALT. 
DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT PROFESSIONAL SOFTWARE, IT IS A GRASSHOPPER SCRIPT THAT IS MEANT TO ENABLE USING PARAMETRIC DESIGN TOOLS FOR EXISTING BUILDINGS.  
IT MAY HAVE GLITCHES :)  
WE WELCOME YOU TO FIX THEM, ADD TO THIS AND ALTER THIS FOR YOUR OWN NEEDS.
